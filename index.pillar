!About me

Coding enthusiast. Mad hatter. Software engineer and researcher. 

I am currently working as a post-doc researcher at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, on security for programming languages in cloud computing applications.

My main topics of interests are the runtime adaptation of applications, Virtual Machine design and development, and programming language tools. For that, I work on reflective applications and programming languages. I participate in the open source community of the *Pharo>http://www.pharo-project.org* programming language and environment.

I obtained the 13 of april 2015 my Phd entitled "Virtualization support for application runtime specialization and extension" under the direction of Stéphane Ducasse (*Inria Rmod team>http://rmod.lille.inria.fr*) and the supervision of Noury Bouraqadi and Luc Fabresse(*CAR team>http://car.mines-douai.fr/* of Mines Douai).


I love coding.
I spend a lot of my free time helping the amazing community of *Pharo>http://www.pharo-project.org*. I also participate in several projects such as the Pharo's database driver suite (*DBXTalk>http://dbxtalk.smallworks.com.ar*), it's shortcut framework, or the static web page generator Ecstatic.
